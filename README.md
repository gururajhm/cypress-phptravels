### Base framework with cypress - testing with phptravels.com

This is an example app used to showcase [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) testing. The application uses every API command in Cypress for demonstration purposes. Additionally this example will run on Circle CI.

## PHPTravels
PHPTravels is a demo website where people can try out the software of an actual travel site. In this project, I have created test cases on the site that range from logging in to searching for hotels. Cypress tool is used to test e2e use cases. This
